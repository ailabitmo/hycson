# HyCSoN

A mobile app working as a generic client for Social Networks providing Hypermedia-based API.

## Mobile app workflow

_TBD_

## Demonstration

Since existing social networks do not currently support Hypermedia API, for demonstration purposes we develop a set of proxy services that sit between a social network's API and the mobile app and enrich the API's messages with hypermedia.

The following social networks are going to be supported:

* VK (http://vk.com)
* Twitter (http://twitter.com)

A proxy service converts an original API to a hypermedia one by using [Hydra Core](http://hydra-cg.com/) and [Schema.org](http://schema.org) vocabularies.
